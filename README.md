Bookmark App

As as a user:

I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:

Title, URL, Link, Description, and Rating (1-5)

I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app.

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating.
I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view.

Detailed view expands to additionally displayed description and a "Visit Site" link.
I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list.

I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark.

All validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required) work properly.
I can select from a dropdown (a select element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection.
